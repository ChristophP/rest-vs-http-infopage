      REST is a popular style of architecting and designing Web applications, which are commonly served
      over HTTP. But what makes an API RESTful and what is a plain HTTP API?
      There seems to be a trend of calling any HTTP based API
      a REST API, even though the API doesn't fulfill all the constraints that
      REST requires. REST's creator Roy Fielding, also voiced his opinion about this in <a
        href="https://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">a blog post on his
        website</a>:

      Let's take a quick look to review, what the <em>REST</em> and <em>HTTP</em> are:

    <div class="flex flex-col mt-4 bg-green-100 shadow-md lg:space-x-4 lg:flex-row rounded-md">
      <h2 class="px-4 mt-2 font-semibold">Definitions</h2>
      <div class="flex-1 px-4 text-sm">
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer"><em>Representational state transfer
              (REST)</em></a> is a software architectural style that defines a set of
          constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style,
          called RESTful Web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. RESTful Web
          services allow the
          requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and
          predefined set of stateless operations.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-1 px-4 text-sm">
        <p>
          The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol"><em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol
              (HTTP)</em></a> is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative,
          hypermedia
          information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext
          documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click
          or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-4">
      <h2 class="mt-8 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">The REST constraints</h2>
      <p class="ml-4 -indent-4">
        <em>REST</em> Web services must follow a set of 6 constraints.
        We will take a closer look at the following two:
      </p>
      <ol class="pl-6 mt-2 list-disc space-y-2">
        <li>Stateless communication</li>
        <li>Uniform interface</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="ml-4 -indent-4">
        <em>Stateless communication</em> means that communication between client and
        server cannot rely on previous requests. For example: Clients can not
        ask servers to send them "the next page", because doing so would require
        that the server maintained some state about, which page the particular client has seen
        last.
      </p>

      <p class="ml-4 -indent-4">
        Instead, the <em>uniform interface</em> constraints impose a number of subconstraints
        namely, identification of resources; manipulation of resources through
        representations; self-descriptive messages; and hypermedia as the engine of application state(sometimes
        abbreviated as HATEOAS).
        This means that Hypertext(or more generally, hypermedia) needs
        to be the driving mechanism by which clients navigate through the application.
        Hypermedia is a data format that can be interlinked. HTML with its
        anchor tags is a good example, but any format with this capability will
        work.
      </p>

      <p class="ml-4 -indent-4">
        So, by using hypermedia servers can directly send clients new
        URIs to navigate to. So instead of storing, which page a client has seen
        last, a server following a REST design will simply include a link to
        page 4 if it received a request for page 3. The client can then use it
        request the next page without the server having to maintain any client state.
      </p>

      <aside class="float-right p-2 ml-4 text-sm bg-gray-200 shadow-md">
        <h3 class="font-semibold">Original REST Constraints</h3>
        <ol class="pl-6 mt-2 list-decimal">
          <li>Client-server</li>
          <li>Stateless</li>
          <li>Cacheable</li>
          <li>Uniform interface</li>
          <li>Layered system</li>
          <li>Code on demand</li>
        </ol>
      </aside>
      <p class="ml-4 -indent-4">
        REST aims to reduce coupling between client and server, so another big benefit
        of including hyperlinks to other resources in the response, is that the client does NOT need
        to know a catalog of available resources up front. It is enough for
        clients to navigate to the inital service URI and then follow links to
        other resources. This enables clients and servers to evolve independently
        because resources can be discovered and do not need to be know.
      </p>


      <p class="ml-4 -indent-4">
        However, most APIs that are declared REST APIs by their makers, do not
        follow the constraint that
        client-server interaction must be hypertext-driven.(HATEOAS)
        Often APIs simply return some JSON and does not contain any links to other
        resources. This tighlty couples client and server because without links
        clients need knowledge of every endpoint up front and breaks RESTful
        design.

      <p>If you recognize these things in your application, there's a high chance,
        that REST constraints are violated.</p>
      <ul class="pl-6 list-disc space-y-2">
        <li> Your clients are performing string concatenation to build resource URLs.<br>
          => REST clients should have no knowledge of resource URLs other than the
          initial one. This demostrates a high coupling between client and server.</li>
        <li>Server responses don't contain links to other resources <br>
          => Violates hypertext/hypermedia constraint. In the inital response clients should receive links to other
          available resources.</li>
        <li>Client says, give me the next page: <br>
          => Violates stateless constraint. To fulfill that the server would have
          to keep track of what the "next page" actually is. The correct RESTful way of doing that would be if the
          server
          returns the current page along with a link to the next one, which can then be used by the client to retrieve
          the next page.</li>

        <li>
          <div class="font-bold text-gray-600">Does REST need to be served over HTTP?</div>
          <p>Nope, there is no constraint that requires HTTP.
            REST happens to map very well to HTTP, though.
            In fact, Roy Fielding was also working on the HTTP/1.1 spec so there
            definitely has been some sort of influence. In practice, virtually all
            implementations of REST use HTTP, even though it is not a requirement.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="font-bold text-gray-600">Are all HTTP APIs automatically REST APIs?</div>
          <p>No, only if they follow the constraints for REST, as laid out in
            <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">Roy Fielding's

        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="font-bold text-gray-600">What is hypertext/hypermedia and HATEOAS?</div>
          <p>It is simply a data format that has a notion of linking to other
            content. HTML is a good example because it has <em>anchor</em> tags
            that connect to other documents. Clients(Browsers) know how to
            transition from one page(resource) to the other simply by understanding
            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type">Media type</a> <em>text/html</em>.

            <b class="text-gray-600">GraphQL:</b> <a href="</a>">GraphQL</a> is
            a query language and not an architectural style.
            GraphQL endpoints are actually somewhat discoverable due to their

            media types or preexisting semantics of a protocol like HTTP.
            GraphQL can be served over HTTP, but if it is then HTTP is treated
            as a dumb transportation layer.

            with REST constraints. This is includes using it's own media type <span
              class="url">application/vnd.api+json</span>,
            using a JSON format that is registered with IANA (available to clients).
            This format can be seen as hypermedia, because it contains links to
            other resources (discoverable) such as "self", "next" or "last".

      - idea a RESTful client client which understands a certain hypermedia format
        can talk to any server that uses this format
      - REST was initially described in the context of HTTP, but is not limited to that protocol. RESTful architectures can be based on other Application Layer protocols if they already provide a rich and uniform vocabulary for applications based on the transfer of meaningful representational state. RESTful applications maximise the use of the pre-existing, well-defined interface and other built-in capabilities provided by the chosen network protocol, and minimise the addition of new application-specific features on top of it.

      <h2 class="mt-8 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="ml-4 -indent-4">The REST architectural style as defined by Roy Fielding defines a set of
        constraints. A lot of times APIs that are called RESTful violate at least
        one of them. Most commonly they violate the <em>Uniform interface</em>
        constraint, because resources are not discoverable due to lacking links
        in responses.</p>
      <p class="ml-4 -indent-4">Hopefully, this page has clarified what REST is and what it isn't.
        While reading, you may have detected a so-called REST API at work or another place,
        that actually should not be called one. If you did please:
      </p>
      <ol class="pl-6 mt-2 list-decimal">
        <li>Stop calling it a REST API.😉. This would make Roy Fielding happy as well.</li>
