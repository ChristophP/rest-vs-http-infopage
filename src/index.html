    <p class="px-4 py-2 ml-4 -indent-4"><em>REST</em> is a popular design principle, which is often used
      for APIs. <em>REST</em> is comprised of a set of constraints, which - when followed -
      make an API <em>RESTful</em>.<br>However, all too often, APIs are falsely labeled as
      <em>REST API</em>, simply because it has become such a trend to have one.

      REST is a popular way of architecting and designing Web applications, which are commonly served
      over HTTP. However, there seems to be a trend of calling any HTTP based API
      a REST API, even though the API doesn't follow basic REST principles.
      What makes an API RESTful and what is a plain HTTP API?

          Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to
          be
          used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful Web
          services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. RESTful Web services allow the
          requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and
          predefined set of stateless operations.

        <h2 class="font-bold">What is HTTP?</h2>
        <p>
          The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia
          information systems.[1] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext
          documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click
          or
          by tapping the screen in a web browser.
