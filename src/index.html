      REST is a popular style of architecting and designing Web applications, which are commonly served
      over HTTP. What makes an API RESTful and what is a plain HTTP API?
      There seems to be a trend of calling any HTTP based API
      a REST API, even though the API doesn't fulfill all the constraints that
      REST requires. REST's creator Roy Fielding, also voiced his opinion about this in <a
        href="https://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">a blog post on his
        website</a>:

      Let's take a quick look to review, what the <em>REST</em> and <em>HTTP</em> are:

      <div class="flex-1 p-4 text-sm">
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer"><em>Representational state transfer
              (REST)</em></a> is a software architectural style that defines a set of
          constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style,
          called RESTful Web
          services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. RESTful Web services allow the
          requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and
          predefined set of stateless operations.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-1 p-4 text-sm">
        <p>
          The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol"><em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol
              (HTTP)</em></a> is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative,
          hypermedia
          information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext
          documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click
          or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-4">
      <h2 class="mt-8 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">The REST constraints</h2>
      <p class="ml-4 -indent-4">
        <em>REST</em> Web services must follow a set of 6 constraints.
        We will take a closer look at the following two:
      </p>
      <ol class="pl-6 mt-2 list-disc">
        <li>Stateless communication</li>
        <li>Uniform interface</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="ml-4 -indent-4">
        <em>Stateless communication</em> means that communication between client and
        server cannot rely on previous requests. For example: Clients can not
        ask servers to send them "the next page", because doing so would require
        that the server maintained some state about, which page the particular client has seen
        last.
      </p>

      <p class="ml-4 -indent-4">
        Instead, the <em>uniform interface</em> constraints impose a number of subconstraints
        namely, identification of resources; manipulation of resources through
        representations; self-descriptive messages; and hypermedia as the engine of application state(sometimes
        abbreviated as HATEOAS).
        This means that Hypertext(or more generally, hypermedia) needs
        to be the driving mechanism by which clients navigate through the application.
        Hypermedia is a data format that can be interlinked. HTML with its
        anchor tags is a good example, but any format with this capability will
        work.
      </p>

      <p class="ml-4 -indent-4">
        So, by using hypermedia servers can directly send clients new
        URIs to navigate to. So instead of storing, which page a client has seen
        last, a server following a REST design will simply include a link to
        page 4 if it received a request for page 3. The client can then use it
        request the next page without the server having to maintain any client state.
      </p>

      <aside class="float-right p-2 ml-4 text-sm bg-gray-200 shadow-md">
        <h3 class="font-semibold">Original REST Constraints</h3>
        <ol class="pl-6 mt-2 list-decimal">
          <li>Client-server</li>
          <li>Stateless</li>
          <li>Cacheable</li>
          <li>Uniform interface</li>
          <li>Layered system</li>
          <li>Code on demand</li>
        </ol>
      </aside>
      <p class="ml-4 -indent-4">
        REST aims to reduce coupling between client and server, so another big benefit
        of including hyperlinks to other resources in the response, is that the client does NOT need
        to know a catalog of available resources up front. It is enough for
        clients to navigate to the inital service URI and then follow links to
        other resources. This enables clients and servers to evolve independently
        because resources can be discovered and do not need to be know.
      </p>


      <p class="ml-4 -indent-4">
        However, most APIs that are declared REST APIs by their makers, do not
        follow the constraint that
        client-server interaction must be hypertext-driven.(HATEOAS)
        Often APIs simply return some JSON and does not contain any links to other
        resources. This tighlty couples client and server because without links
        clients need knowledge of every endpoint up front and breaks RESTful
        design.

        <li>Client says, give me the next page: -> Violates stateless constraint. To fulfill that the server would have
          to
          keep track of what the "next page" actually is. The correct RESTful way of doing that would be if the server
          returns the current page along with a link to the next one, which can then be used by the client to retrieve
          the next page.</li>

      <ul class="pl-6 list-disc">
        <li>
          <div class="font-bold">Does REST need to be served over HTTP?</div>
          <p>Nope, other protocols work too. REST happens to map very well to HTTP, though.
            In fact, Roy Fielding was also working on the HTTP/1.1 spec so there
            definitely has been some sort of influence. In practice, virtually all
            implementations of REST use HTTP even though it is not a requirement.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="font-bold">Are all HTTP APIs automatically REST APIs?</div>
          <p>No, only if they follow the constraints for REST, as laid out in
            <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">Roy Fielding's
              dissertation</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="font-bold">What is hypertext/hypermedia and HATEOAS?</div>
          <p>It is simply a data format that has a notion of linking to other
            content. HTML is a good example because it has <em>anchor</em> tags
            that connect to other documents. Clients(Browsers) know how to
            transition from one page(resource) to the other simply by understanding
            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type">Media type</a> <em>text/html</em>.

            - GraphQL? Is a query language and not an architectural style.<br>
            - ProtoBuf? Nope<br>
            - JSON API: Is a specification for APIs using JSON. Although it
            does not explicitly label itself as following REST, it implements
            many constraints correctly and promotes a style that it is plays well
            with REST constraints, including: using it's own media type application/vnd.api+json,
            using a JSON format that is well-specified (available to clients),
            works with responses that link to other resources (discoverable)

      - it[REST] is a network of Web resources (a virtual state-machine) where the user progresses through the application by selecting resource identifiers such as http://www.example.com/articles/21 and resource operations such as GET or POST (application state transitions), resulting in the next resource's representation (the next application state) being transferred to the end user for their use. wikipedia
      - REST was initially described in the context of HTTP, but is not limited to that protocol. RESTful architectures can be based on other Application Layer protocols if they already provide a rich and uniform vocabulary for applications based on the transfer of meaningful representational state. RESTful applications maximise the use of the pre-existing, well-defined interface and other built-in capabilities provided by the chosen network protocol, and minimise the addition of new application-specific features on top of it.
      - From <a href="https://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">here's a set of ways to check if you're building a HTTP API or a REST API:</a>

      <h2 class="mt-8 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="ml-4 -indent-4">The REST architectural style as defined by Roy Fielding defines a set of
        constraints. A lot of times APIs that are called RESTful violate at least
        one of them. Most commonly they violate the <em>Uniform interface</em>
        constraint, because resources are not discoverable due to lacking links
        in responses.</p>
      <p class="ml-4 -indent-4">Hopefully, this page has clarified what REST is and what it isn't.
        While reading, you may have detected a so-called REST API at work or another place,
        that actually should not be called one. If you did please:
      </p>
      <ol class="pl-6 mt-2 list-decimal">
        <li>Stop calling it a REST API.😉. This would make Roy Fielding happy as well.</li>
        <li>Kindly, pass on this knowledge or the link to this website to
          other people, who you feel might benefit from learning what
          REST is truly about. 🙏</li>
