      REST is a popular style of architecting and designing Web applications, which are commonly served
      over HTTP. What makes an API RESTful and what is a plain HTTP API?
      There seems to be a trend of calling any HTTP based API
      a REST API, even though the API doesn't fulfill all the constraints that
      REST requires. As

          <em>Representational state transfer (REST)</em> is a software architectural style that defines a set of
          constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style,
          called RESTful Web
          services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. RESTful Web services allow the
          requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and
          predefined set of stateless operations.

          The <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</em> is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative,
          hypermedia
          information systems.[1] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext
          documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click
          or
          by tapping the screen in a web browser.

      <p><em>REST</em> Web services must follow a set of constaints. Most API
        that are declared REST APIs by their makers, follow only parts of the
        constraints. The one that is broken the most is the constraint that
        client-server interaction must be hypertext-driven.(HATEOAS)
        - client must only now intial entrypoint
        - resources link to each other
        - clients know how to follow links based on media type
        - Browsers an websites are a RESTful system
        - state in response, or state to server in URI

      <p>If you recognize these things in your application, there's a high chance,
        that REST constraints are violated.</p>
      <ul class="pl-6 list-disc">
        <li>Client concatenating URIs -> Not RESTful</li>
        <li>Server responses don't contain links to other resources -> Violates hypertext/hypermedia constraint</li>
        <li>Client says, give me the next page: -> Violates stateless constraint. To fulfill that the server would have
          to
          keep track of what the "next page" actually is. The correct RESTful way of doing that would be if the server
          returns the current page along with a link to the next one, which can then be used by the client to retrieve
          the next page.</li>

        <li>
          <div class="font-bold">Does REST need to be served over HTTP?</div>
          <p>Nope, other protocols work too. REST happens to map very well to HTTP, though.
            In fact, Roy Fielding was also working on the HTTP/1.1 spec so there
            definitely has been some sort of influence. In practice, virtually all
            implementations of REST use HTTP even though it is not a requirement.</p>

      - idea a RESTful client client which understands a certain hypermedia format
        can talk to any server that uses this format
      - it[REST] is a network of Web resources (a virtual state-machine) where the user progresses through the application by selecting resource identifiers such as http://www.example.com/articles/21 and resource operations such as GET or POST (application state transitions), resulting in the next resource's representation (the next application state) being transferred to the end user for their use. wikipedia
      - REST was initially described in the context of HTTP, but is not limited to that protocol. RESTful architectures can be based on other Application Layer protocols if they already provide a rich and uniform vocabulary for applications based on the transfer of meaningful representational state. RESTful applications maximise the use of the pre-existing, well-defined interface and other built-in capabilities provided by the chosen network protocol, and minimise the addition of new application-specific features on top of it.
      - What is Rest -
        1- Client-server
        2- Stateless
        3- Cacheable
        4- Layered system
        5- Code on demand
        6- Uniform interface

      <p>Hopefully, this page has clarified what REST is and what it isn't.
        While reading, you may have detected a so-called REST API at work or another place,
        that actually should not be called one. If you did please:

        <li>Stop calling it a REST API.😉. This would make Roy Fielding happy as well.</li>
